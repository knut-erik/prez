-> # The four essential freedoms <-

1. The freedom to **run** the program as you wish, for any purpose.
2. The freedom to **study** how the program works,
   and **change** it so it does your computing as you wish.
3. The freedom to **redistribute** copies so you can help others.
4. The freedom to **distribute** copies of your modified versions to others.


- The _Open Source_ movement in software began as a response to the limitations of proprietary code
- C-Suites / board rooms mixed _free_ with _gratis_
- _"Free software"_ was seen as discouraging business adoption
- The term _Open Source_ was coined (Christine Peterson - 1998)
